# Release History

## 20.09 (November 22, 2020)

  * Update nixpkgs to pull in GHC 8.8.4 and 8.10.2.

  * Update ghcide to version 0.5.0.

  * Update cabal-fmt to version 0.1.5.

  * Update hlint to version 3.2.2.

  * Add [haskell-language-server](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server) at version 0.6.0.

  * Add [stan](https://github.com/kowainik/stan) at version 0.0.1.0.

  * Use `callCabal2nixWithOptions` instead of a custom solution (#5)

  * New `haskell-packages-overlay.nix` file so nix-hs can patch broken
    Haskell packages that prevent the tests from passing.

  * The standalone shell file has been renamed from `nix/shell.nix` to
    `nix/shell/default.nix` and all of the interactive tool files have
    been moved into `nix/shell`.

  * Interactive tools such as `ghcide` and `ormolu` are built from a
    pinned version of nixpkgs.  Everything else, including GHC and
    packages, are built from the nixpkgs passed to nix-hs.

  * Releases will now track NixOS

  * NOTE: the `enableFullyStaticExecutables` flag is deprecated and
    will be removed in the next release.  It can easily be replaced by
    giving nix-hs a package set from `static-haskell.nix`.

## 2.0 (June 7, 2020)

  * Automatically build the latest versions of `ghcide` and `ormolu`
    instead of using the ones in `pkgs.haskellPackages`.

  * Added [cabal-fmt](https://github.com/phadej/cabal-fmt) to the list
    of interactive development tools.

  * Added files for `nix-shell` that can be used with `direnv` to load
    all interactive development tools into `PATH`.  Useful when you
    are working on a project that does not use `nix-hs` but you want
    to easily use the tools it builds for you.

    To use one of these files put this line in an `.envrc` file:

    ```sh
    use nix /path/to/nix-hs/nix/shell.nix
    ```

  * Build fully static binaries (via [static-haskell-nix][]) by
    setting `enableFullyStaticExecutables` to `true`.

  * Created a binary cache via Cachix to store dynamically and
    statically linked compilers and tools.

  * Added tests and configured GitHub actions
