A thin layer over the existing [Haskell][] infrastructure in
[nixpkgs][] which adds all of the tools needed for interactive
development.  Here are some of the features that you might find the
most useful:

  * An interactive development environment (via `nix-shell`) that
    includes:

      * GHC (8.6.5, 8.8.4, or 8.10.2)

      * `cabal` 3.2.0

      * `stack` 2.3.3

      * [hlint][] 3.2.6

      * [ghcide][ghcide] 0.7.0

      * [haskell-language-server][] 0.8.0

      * [ormolu][ormolu] 0.1.4.1

      * [cabal-fmt][cabal-fmt] 0.1.5

      * [stan][stan] 0.0.1.0

      * and a Hoogle database for all of your project's dependencies

  * Easy to use system for [overriding Haskell packages](#using-a-broken-package) (e.g., use
    a package not on Hackage, fix a package marked as broken, etc.)
    without having to write tons of Nix code.

  * Works seamlessly with [direnv][], [lorri][], and [niv][] if you
    already have those tools installed.

  * Switch GHC versions by passing an argument to `nix-build` or
    `nix-shell`.

  * [Strip dependencies](#access-to-binary-only-packages) from a package so you can deploy just a
    binary without tons of other packages coming along for the ride.

  * Create an interactive development environment [without adding
    nix-hs](#interactive-environments-without-nix-hs) as a project dependency.

  * Fetch pre-built tools from [the binary cache](#using-the-binary-cache).

## Geting Started

Create a `default.nix` file that looks something like this:

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> { }
}:
let
  nix-hs =
    import
      (fetchTarball
        "https://github.com/pjones/nix-hs/archive/release-20.09.tar.gz")
      {
        inherit pkgs;
      };
in
nix-hs {
  cabal = ./test/hello-world/hello-world.cabal;
}
```

And a `shell.nix` that looks like this:

```nix
# Load an interactive environment:
(import ./. {}).interactive
```

That's it!  Now `nix-build` and `nix-shell` just work!

## Configuration

In addition to the `cabal` argument to the `nix-hs` function, there
are other ways to control how your package is built.

### Enable Flags from the Cabal File

If you have a flag defined in your package's cabal file you can enable
it using the `flags` argument:

```nix
nix-hs {
  cabal = ./mypackage.cabal;
  flags = [ "someflagname" ];
}
```

### Using a Broken Package

If one of your package's dependencies can't be built you can try
overriding it:

```nix
nix-hs {
  cabal = ./mypackage.cabal;

  overrides = lib: self: super: with lib; {
    pipes-text = unBreak (dontCheck (doJailbreak super.pipes-text));
  };
}
```

In the example above, the `overrides` function takes three arguments:

  1. `lib`: An attribute set of library functions.  These are the
     functions provided by the `pkgs.haskellPackages.lib` set plus a
     few more that you might find useful such as:

     - `unBreak`: Remove the `broken` flag from a package
     - `compilerName`: The nixpkgs name of the Haskell compiler
       being used (e.g. `ghc884`)
     - `pkgs`: The full package set, after overriding

  2. `self`: The final set of Haskell packages after applying all
     overrides.  This refers to the future version of the package set
     so if you're not careful you can fall into infinite recursion.
     When in doubt use `super` instead.

  3. `super`: The set of Haskell packages that are being modified.
     Use this attribute set to refer to existing Haskell packages.
     You can also use `super` to access useful functions such as
     `callCabal2nix` and `callHackageDirect`.

The `overrides` function should return an attribute set of Haskell
packages.  The set of returned packages will be merged into the final
set used to build your package.

### Working with Multi-Package Cabal Projects

If you have a project that contains multiple Cabal packages you can
build them all with a single `default.nix`.  The `cabal` argument to
`nix-hs` can either be a path to a Cabal file *or* an attribute set of
Cabal files:

```nix
nix-hs {
  cabal = {
    package1 = ./package1/package1.cabal;
    package2 = ./package1/package2.cabal;
  };
}
```
## Integrating Your Text Editor and Shell

The best way to let your text editor and shell use the environment
created from Nix is to use [direnv][].  Here's an example `.envrc`
file:

```sh
# Use lorri if it's installed, otherwise load shell.nix:
if has lorri; then
  eval "$(lorri direnv)"
else
  use nix
fi

# Reload if these files change:
watch_file $(find . -name '*.cabal' -o -name '*.nix')
```

**NOTE:** Make sure you have a `shell.nix` file that exposes the
`interactive` attribute of the derivation, like the example above.

## Interactive Environments Without nix-hs

If you don't want to use `nix-hs` to control your `default.nix` you
can still use it for building an interactive development environment.
Just clone this repository and use the `nix/shell/default.nix` file.

For example, to drop into an interactive shell:

```
$ nix-shell /path/to/nix-hs/nix/shell
```

Or

```
$ nix-shell --argstr compiler 8.8.3 /path/to/nix-hs/nix/shell
```

Even better, use [direnv][] so your normal shell and text editor can
see all the installed development tools.  Here's an example `.envrc`
file:

```sh
use nix /path/to/nix-hs/nix/shell
```

## Access to Binary-Only Packages

The derivation generated by the `nix-hs` function makes it easy to
access a "binary only" derivation.  This is perfect for deployments or
Docker containers where you don't want to bring along all of your
package's dependencies (including GHC).

The `bin` attribute of the derivation gives you access to this binary
only derivation.  For example, to create a docker container put the
following in `docker.nix`:

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> { }
}:

let
  mypackage = (import ./. { inherit pkgs; }).bin;

in pkgs.dockerTools.buildImage {
  name = "mypackage";
  tag  = "latest";

  config = {
    Cmd = [ "${mypackage}/bin/hello" ];
  };
}
```

## Using the Binary Cache

If you don't want to spend all day compiling the tools needed to build
your Haskell package and its development environment you can use the
`nix-hs` cache [on Cachix](https://app.cachix.org/cache/nix-hs).

The cache is populated after each `git push` via a [GitHub
action](https://github.com/pjones/nix-hs/actions) and even includes
the statically compiled versions of GHC needed for building [fully
static binaries](#fully-static-binaries).

NOTE: Due to disk space limitations the cache is limited to the
current LTS version of GHC.
